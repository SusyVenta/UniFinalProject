Project Idea Title 1: Deep Learning on a public dataset
What problem is this project solving?
Choosing, based on a quantitative evaluation, a well performing machine learning model for used
with a publicly available dataset. 
What is the background and context to the question above in 150 words or less?
Pick a dataset from Kaggle.com – choose one that interests you or you think is important – for
example: tweets, faces, lung scans, skin diseases, student grades…
Develop a deep learning classificatation/regression model for your chosen dataset by following the
methodology of Deep Learning with Python. Aim to find the best model – work from simple to deep
and employ the advanced techniques of Chapter 7. 


Project Idea Title 2: Gather your own dataset
What problem is this project solving?
Gathering a data set and training a model to develop a classification system
What is the background and context to the question above in 150 words or less?
Most practical machine learning involves gathering data, labelling it and using it to train a machine
learning model. The data gathering challenge as it is important to gather data that is representative
of real world data and that distinguishes well between the different classes. Contemporary Deep
Learning techniques often need huge datasets, into the 10s or 100s of thousands of items, which
would not be feasible for this kind of project. But it is possible to build on pre-trained datasets which
can be used as features extractors. The aim of this project is to gather a dataset of a moderate size
(100s), including both training and testing sets. We recommend a dataset of images as there are
plenty of good pre-trained models. You can either generate the dataset yourself (taking images or
video) or curate existing unlabelled images. You should label the images and train a machine
learning model, based on a pre-trained model, on the dataset. You should try a number of variant
models, from simple to complex and using different pre-trained models if they exist, and compare
the results. Iterative development should include both improvements to the model and dataset. 


Project Idea Title 1: A non-profit web application
What problem is this project solving?
You should build a web application that can help users tackle or solve a socially useful problem in the
non-profit sector.
What is the background and context to the question above in 150 words or less?
A large number of web applications are built for primarily for commercial reasons, to sell products to
people. These include stores such as Amazon, Etsy and Ebay. One area of application development
that is often under-served are non-commercial applications. Often times non-commercial
applications do not attract funding. It is your job to identify a social problem that could be address
by a web application and to build that web application. Such an applications may be designed to
help a charity or governmental or address some other social issue.

SSL/HTTPS security certificates and authorities are valid.


Project Idea Title 2: A Collaboration web application
What problem is this project solving?
Build an application that helps people collaborate more effectively
What is the background and context to the question above in 150 words or less?
Humans need to collaborate in all aspects of their lives, from work to schools to hobbies. In
this project you need to find an aspect of collaboration that could be served with an
appropriate web application. This may range from enabling scheduling to collaborating
simultaneously on a piece of work. In this project you’re tasked with building a web
application whose main focus is to enable collaboration between a group of people.

2) Web Development - Better free Trello / Asana
    * Asana limitations: 
        * does not dynamically allocate time to milestones based on single tasks 
        * does not allow to see original timelines given and monitor delay. only allows to change expected delivery date and start date. -> can add this feature which automatically calculates a delay field. -> helps to be aware of buffers needed to add to initial timelines.

3) Web development - trip planner
    * social media app that allows users to sign up and plan trips: from proposing destinations, to 
        tracking accomodation, transportation, and activities booking. 
    * allows to define to do list, assign tasks to people, create surveys, comment to save links and threaded topics
    * individual profile showing map of all places visited and when
    * asks for destinations, creates a line block with destinations. in-between you see transportation. In each location accomodation.
    * steps:
        1) add participants
        2) enter availability dates. send notifications to all. 
        3) enter places you'd like to visit. send a notifications to all
