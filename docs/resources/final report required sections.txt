Project report outline
It is now time to start bringing together all of your work on your project into a final report. In this topic you will submit a draft for feedback from our tutors. 

The project report should consist of 6 chapters, most of which will be based on writing you have been doing throughout the project process:

Introduction: this will explain the project concept and motivation for the project (this can be based on your proposal). This must also state which project template you are using.  

Literature review: this is a revised version of the document that you submit for your second peer review.

Design: this is a revised version of the document that you submit for your third peer review.

Implementation: this should describe the implementation of the project. This should follow the style of the topic 6 peer review (but greatly expanded to cover the entire implementation), describing the major algorithms/techniques used, explanation of the most important parts of the code and a visual representation of the results (e.g. screenshots or graphs). 

Evaluation: describe the evaluation carried out (e.g. user studies or testing on data) and give the results. This should give a critical evaluation of the project as a whole making clear successes, failures, limitations and possible extensions.

Conclusion: This can be a short summary of the project as a whole but it can also bring out any broader themes you would like to discuss or suggest further work.
