Hello everyone. 

For my final project I want to develop a web application called TripMates, which allows friends to plan and track trips collaboratively. 

I have chosen the second idea of the Advanced Web development template: a web application that helps people collaborate more effectively.

Why would people need an application to plan trips together? 

Let's look at some statistics about travel booking in 2023. 

The majority of American adults prefer booking their trips online, especially from their phone. 
Travelers visit on average 38 websites to finalize and book their travel plans. 
The biggest frustration standing in the way of planning a trip is the fact of having to compare different options. 

TripMates aims to be the first social network application on the market that facilitates planning 
trips as a group online, minimizing the so called "analysis paralysis" associated with the planning process. 

The idea of developing this app comes from the personal experience of planning trips as a group of friends.  
Everyone has different date preferences, people post different options on a chat. There is no systematic way to track these options and the 
result is that it takes forever to make any decision. 

With TripMates instead, users can enter personal date and destination preferences and find common availability. 

Tripmates recognizes its users needs: having to compare different trip options and overcome the "analysis paralysis".
Users can prepare different trip options, assign research tasks to their friends, and let friends vote to facilitate decision making.

This way, TripMates allows to finalize your trip plans faster. 

On top of this, through gamification, TripMates introduces competition and it motivates its users to travel and share visited locations 
with their friendsthrough a scratch-map view.
