# Intro

* **Discovery**: who are users, why are you designing it?
    * weeks 1 - 6
    * **Choose 1 project template**
    * **Research related work.** do background research. find out about similar project and who are final users. What domain?
        * **critiquing previous work**
            * what previous work exists? What's missing in this previous work that I want to do instead?
            * how is my work going to be different and why do we need the differences? Advantages
            * previous ways of doing the same thing? not necessarily tech
            * lay out pros and cons of the system. benefits and problems
            * SWOT analysis
        * test: does your background research support your project idea? Do you need to change something? 
        * ethics: is your app going to do harm? check copyrighted stuff. avoid children/medical/animals related stuff
            * Personal data
                You should be very careful with the use of personal data in your project, whether you gather it yourself, or use third party data. You should ensure that you have full consent to use it in the way you intend. In particular, you should consider the following:

                any information sheet and consent form should include clear explanations of the data issues identified above, with explicit questions to be answered (as in the templates provided)

                as a general principle, personal data should only be stored on secure college computers/servers, approved cloud storage (currently OneDrive), or – if in hard copy, such as consent forms – kept separately in locked filing cabinets on college premises; data collected in the field before transfer to Goldsmiths must be kept securely at all times (for example, laptops and other devices should be password protected and data files must be encrypted)

                recordings, images and videos are to be regarded as personal data, and cannot be regarded as anonymised even with voices or faces disguised: these should only be retained with the explicit permission of the participant (discipline-specific and professional codes of conduct will give further guidance) 

    * define aims of project
    * deliver project proposal - pitch to other students in peer review and then teachers to get feedback.
        * 
    * write literature review. summary and evaluation of all background research
    * concept pitch - **prepare pitch video**
        * video presentation in peer review
        * marking criteria:
            * does the video display knowledge of the area of study and previous work? 
            * does the video critically evaluate the previous work? how does previous work inform / inpact on the aims of the project? what previous work has not done, I'll do in the project.
            * is the project concept justified based on the domain and users? Based on the background research, can you justify the choices made in terms of design?
        * grading scale for each marking criteria:
            * no
            * no but
            * yes but
            * yes
            * yes and 
    * project proposal marking criteria:
        * does the report display knowledge of the area of study, previous work and academic literature? 
        * does the report critically evaluate the previous work and or academic literature? 
        * is the project concept justified based on the domain and users? 
    * app aimed at ... who face key challenges ... address these in the app. supporting motivation: stats. -> so has this feature. state clearly user requirements. cite literature - where user requirements come from. compose clear plan addressing all requirements. 
    * literature review == competitors analysis
        * download all similar apps on the store, explore features. critically evaluate.
        * referencing guidelines https://onlinelibrary.london.ac.uk/support/referencing 
* Design
    * weeks 6 - 11: 
    * developing a design document. Sections:
        * project overview
        * domain and users
        * justify features based on domani and users 
        * structure of the project: design of UI, software architecture
        * key technologies and methods
        * work plan, Gantt chart with key milestones and how i plan to reach milestones
        * evaluation plan: how / with what techniques will I evaluate is project is succesful
    * design the project. architecture, algorithms, methods, techniques
    * build work plan (agile software projects - milestones, Gantt chart, critical path chart)
    * evaluation plan: how will I know the project works? testing, unit testing, etc. success criteria.
    * first prototype
    * testing: 
        * does your background research support your project design?
        * test design with users: show wireframes
        * feature prototype testing
    * marking criteria:
        * is the design of the project clear and of high quality? 
        * is the project concept justified based on the domain and users? 
        * is the workplan explained in enough detail?  Have you got a suitable number of milestones? And is it feasible? can you justify that you can do this?
        * is the evaluation strategy appropriate to the aims of the project? 
* Development - implementation + testing
    * programming
    * testing
    * iteration of above
    * technical write-up 
* Delivery - deployment: making available to users. 
    * final prototype
    * final report 
    * include final evaluation explaining how project achieves its goals
    * final video presentation - demo
